# Discord Dumper

A script written in go to dump all the messages sent, received, or have access to within a discord account using an account's discord token.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vulnlol/GoDiscordDumper`
2. Enter the repository: `cd GoDiscordDumper`
3. Run the script: `go run dumper.go`

## Warning
Using this is against Discord's TOS I believe so you shouldn't use it. And it probably can get you IP address flagged as well as any account you use to log the messages cause you are basically accessing hundreds of thousands of messages and any metadata attached to them.
